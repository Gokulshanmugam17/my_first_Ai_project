# 🤖 Suji - AI Voice Assistant (Beginner Project)

**Suji** is my first AI personal assistant project using Python. It can listen to voice commands, speak back, search the web, check weather, recommend movies, open apps like Google, YouTube, and more. It also has a basic GUI built with Tkinter.

## 💡 What Suji Can Do

- 🎙️ Understand voice commands (using `speech_recognition`)
- 🗣️ Speak responses (using `pyttsx3`)
- 🔍 Search Wikipedia and Google
- 🌦️ Show weather info (OpenWeatherMap API)
- 🎥 Search YouTube videos
- 🗺️ Open Google Maps
- 🧠 Answer simple questions using WolframAlpha
- 📸 Open camera and take a photo (on Windows)
- ⏰ Tell time, open calculator, recommend movies
- 🖥️ Simple GUI with start and quit buttons

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia requests wolframalpha ecapture
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
